### Deliverables
- [x] ArchiMate model of the enterprise architecture.
- [x] Context map.
- [ ] Non-functional requirements.
- [ ] Functional requirements added to the given requirements, based on assumptions.
- [ ] Implementation of all functional and non-functional requirements as described for your case.
- [ ] Postman or Swagger scripts that trigger the various RESTful Web API's to allow showing that functionality works. So, there's no need to create a GUI in order to save you work.
- [ ] Docker image of your application. 
- [ ] Motivation of each of the following concepts as applied to your case in a document. Use of these concepts is mandatory. Describe where it is applied and why it is applied:
  - [ ] Microservices based on the principles of DDD
  - [ ] Eventual consistency
  - [ ] Event driven architecture based on messaging
  - [ ] Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
  - [ ] Event Sourcing
  - [ ] Enterprise Integration Patterns (at least one)

### Non functionals
Modularity
Fault tolerance
Scalability
Availability
Maintainability

Every service should function without any of the other services
When one part of the application goes down, the rest of the app should stay available
Any part of the app should be scalable to handle increased traffic
While a part of the app is maintained, the rest of the app should stay available

### Functional requirements 
Tickets can be cancelled by the customer 
Airstrips can be reserved for flights 
Status of flights can be tracked 
Plane can't fly before fuel check
